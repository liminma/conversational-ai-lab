      "Stephen Hawking was a renowned theoretical physicist, cosmologist and author who made groundbreaking contributions to our understanding of the universe, including the now famous theory of black holes and the discovery that black holes emit radiation. He was also known for his work on quantum mechanics, general relativity and the origins of the cosmos. Despite being diagnosed with a rare form of motor neuron disease at the age of 21, he continued to make important contributions to science until his death in 2018.\n",
