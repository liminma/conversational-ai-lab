However, let me assure you that pandas are not just for kids; even adults like me can’t resist their charm.\nFrom the moment my daughter unwrapped this gift, she has been inseparable from her new companion. The plush toy’s irresistibly soft and cuddly texture makes it the perfect companion for any adventure. Its cuteness factor is off the charts, and it never fails to bring a smile to my daughter’s face.\nHowever, I must mention that there is a slight flaw in the design. One of the panda’s ears is positioned slightly lower than the other, which appears to be unintentional. While this asymmetry does not detract from the overall appeal, it is worth noting for those seeking perfection.\nIn terms of size, I must admit that I expected a slightly larger plush toy considering its price. It would be beneficial for potential buyers to explore alternative options that offer a larger size for the same price. Nevertheless, the quality and craftsmanship of this panda plush toy are undeniable.\nTo my surprise, the delivery of this product exceeded my expectations. It arrived a day earlier than the estimated delivery date, allowing me to indulge in some playtime with the panda before presenting it to my daughter. This unexpected bonus added to the overall excitement and anticipation surrounding the gift.\nIn conclusion, this panda plush toy is a delightful gift that transcends age boundaries. Its softness, cuteness, and undeniable charm make it a perfect companion for anyone. While there may be other options available in terms of size, the quality and timely delivery of this product make it a worthwhile purchase. So, whether you’re a child or a child at heart, this panda plush toy is sure to bring joy and warmth to your life."

    "text": "How does the attention mechanism work?\nThe purpose of the attention is to compute a context vector for the decoder to generate output sequence. The whole process is done in 3 steps, as illustrated in the following figure [1]:\n\nthe encoder computes annotations for every word in the input sequence.\nthe decode use an alignment model to compute attention scores based on the annotations from the encoder\nfinally, the decoder compute the context vector using the attention scores and the annotations\n\n\n Image source: Bahdanau et al. [1]\n\n\nStep 1: compute annotations\nThe encoder uses a bidirectional RNN (BiRNN) so that the annotation of each word \\(j\\) summarizes both the preceding and following words. The results are a forward hidden state \\(\\overrightarrow{h_j}\\) and a backward hidden state \\(\\overleftarrow{h_j}\\), which are concatenated to form the annotation: \\(h_j=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\overrightarrow{h}_j \\\\ \\overleftarrow{h}_j\\end{array}\\right]\\)\n\n\nstep 2: compute attention scores\nThe decoder uses an alignment model to compute attention scores. The authors chose a single-layer MLP as the alignment model, \\[\na(s_{i-1}, h_j) = v_a^\\intercal\\ tanh(W_a s_{i-1} + U_a h_j)\n\\] \\(W_a\\), \\(U_a\\) and \\(v_a\\) are weight matrices. \\(h_j\\) is the \\(j\\)-th annotation from the source sequence. \\(s_{i-1}\\) is the decoder state at time \\(i-1\\).\nAt time \\(i\\), given the \\(j\\)-th annotation \\(h_j\\), the attention score \\(e_{ij}\\) is computed using the previous decoder state \\(s_{i-1}\\), \\[\ne_{ij} = a(s_{i-1}, h_j)\n\\]\n\n\nstep 3: compute context vector\nA context vector is a weighted sum of annotations. At time \\(i\\), the context vector can be defined as, \\[\nc_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{T_x} \\alpha_{ij}h_j\n\\] Here, \\(T_x\\) is the length of the source sequence. The weights \\(\\alpha_{ij}\\) are the results of appying softmax to the attention scores from step 2."

    "text": "2. Load and fine-tune the model with QLoRA\nQLoRA [1] is an efficient fine-tuning method for LLMs that reduces memory usage while preserving the performance of full 16-bit fine-tuning. It backpropagates gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pre-trained model into Low Rank Adapters (LoRA). LoRA adapters are trainable rank decomposition matrices injected into each layer of the Transformer architecture, which reduce the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. QLoRA has the following components:\n\n4-bit NormalFloat (NF4) Quantization: the NormalFloat data type is optimal for zero-centered normally distributed data.\nDouble Quantization: a technique for additional memory savings.\nPaged Optimizers: swap optimizer states between CPU and GPU using NVIDIA unified memory to prevent GPU out of memory errors.\n\n\nload and prepare the model for 4bit training\n\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, BitsAndBytesConfig\nfrom peft import prepare_model_for_kbit_training\n\nmodel_id = \"meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf\"\n\n# \n# load model in NF4 quantization with double quantization,\n# set compute dtype to bfloat16\n# \nbnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(\n    load_in_4bit=True,\n    bnb_4bit_quant_type=\"nf4\",\n    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,\n    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16\n)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_id,\n    quantization_config=bnb_config,\n    use_cache=False,\n    device_map=\"auto\",\n)\nmodel = prepare_model_for_kbit_training(model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuse SFTTrainer from trl for training\n\nFirst, define a utility function to format prompts.\n\ndef prompt_formatter(sample):\n    return f\"\"\"&lt;s&gt;### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. \\\nYour task is to summarize the following dialogue. \\\nYour answer should be based on the provided dialogue only.\n\n### Dialogue:\n{sample['dialogue']}\n\n### Summary:\n{sample['summary']} &lt;/s&gt;\"\"\"\n\nn = 0\nprint(prompt_formatter(train_dataset[n]))\n\n&lt;s&gt;### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

    "text": "Source: Madaan et al. [1]\nSelf-refine [1] is an approach that iteratively improves a model’s output based on its own feedback. It is suitable for stronger models. Given an initial output, it consists of 2 main steps: feedback and refine. The feedback contains concrete actions that can improve the output and identifies specific phrases in the output to be improved. Good feedback is cruicial for the approach to work.\nSelf-refine uses three prompts: initial generation, feedback and refinement. The authors used few-shot prompting as in-context learning to guide the model:\nThis notebook experiments with self-refine for constrained generation using Gemini 1.5 models.\nImport necessary libraries\nimport json\nimport nltk\nimport os\nimport re\nimport spacy\nimport sys\nimport time\nimport google.generativeai as genai\n\nfrom google.ai.generativelanguage import Part, Content\nfrom urllib.request import urlopen\n\nsys.path.append('../src')\nimport utils\n\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nload_dotenv();"

    "title": "Understanding ReAct Prompting",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In their paper, Yao et al. [1] introduce ReAct, a method that leverages the reasoning and decision-making capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks. ReAct can generate verbal reasoning traces and task specific actions in an interleaved fashion. This allows LLMs to solve tasks by creating and adjusting action plans, handling exceptions, and interacting with external sources. ReAct combines the pretrained internal knowledge of LLMs with additional information from external sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, as illustrated in the following figure [2]:\n\n\n\nAccording to the authors,\n\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting relies on models’ internal knowledge for reasoning and lacks grounding in the external world, which can result in problems of hallucination and error propagation.\nPlanning and acting in interactive environments does not exploit LLMs’ ability of abstract reasoning about high-level goals or maintaining a working memory.\n\nTherefore, ReAct approach prompts LLMs to produce both verbal reasoning traces and task specific actions in an interleaved fashion. This enables models to perform dynamic reasoning to create, maintain, and adjust high- level plans for acting, and also interact with external environments (e.g. Wikipedia) to incorporate additional information into reasoning.\nThe ReAct prompts include in-context examples, which are human trajectories of actions, thoughts, and observations to solve a task. They are constructed slightly differently based on the type of tasks. For knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks, a trajectory consists of multiple thought-action-observation steps. For decision making tasks, sparse and versatile reasoning is preferred. It only need to appear in the most relevant positions in a trajectory.\nThere are various types of useful thoughts,\n\ndecomposing task goals and create action plans\ninjecting commonsense knowledge relevant to task solving\nextracting important parts from observations\ntrack progress and transit action plans\nhandle exceptions and adjust action plans\n\nThe authors list the prompts they used in Appendix C of the paper. Here is one example trajectory for a knowledge-intensive question,\n\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the “The Simpsons” character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to “The Simpsons” character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up “named after”.\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous.\nThought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] S.

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\nbest models from the literature.

The input consists of\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\nquery with all keys, divide each bypdk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\nvalues.\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\nthe matrix of outputs as:\nAttention(Q;K;V ) = softmax(QKT\npdk)V (1)\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\nof1pdk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\nmuch faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\nmatrix multiplication code.\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms"

This type of tree is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which grow in clusters and are typically 1-8 inches long. Pine trees have a distinct fragrance and produce cones that contain the seeds of the plant. The bark of a pine tree is usually thick and scaly, with deep furrows, providing protection from the elements. Pine trees can grow to be very tall, sometimes reaching over 80 feet in height, and have a conical shape with branches that are often level or slightly ascending. They are also known for their longevity, with some species capable of living for hundreds or thousands of years. [/INST]Describe the attributes of a pine tree.&lt;/s&gt;"

Their experimental results indicate that CoT prompting allows LLMs to perform challenging symbolic reasoning tasks, and able to handle more reasoning steps for inference-time inputs. CoT prompting also leads to almost 100% solve rates for PaLM 540B on the in-domain test sets, and upward scaling curves for the out-of-domain test sets."

Pictures's  Barbie and Universal Pictures's Oppenheimer, on July 21, 2023 in the United States and several other countries. The word is a portmanteau of the films' titles. The contrast of Barbie—a fantasy comedy by Greta Gerwig about the fashion doll Barbie—and Oppenheimer—an epic biographical thriller by Christopher Nolan about physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, scientific director of the Manhattan Project—prompted a comedic response from Internet users, including memes and merchandise. Polygon described the two films as \"extreme opposites\", and Variety called the phenomenon \"the movie event of the year\".The phenomenon began on social media before the films' release. The simultaneous release was an instance of counterprogramming. As their release date approached, instead of generating a rivalry, suggestions emerged to watch the films as a double feature—as well as what order to watch them—and cast members of both responded by encouraging audiences to watch the films on the same day. Celebrity participants included actor Tom Cruise, who purchased tickets to watch both while his latest film, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, was still playing in theaters. \nBoth films received widespread critical acclaim and exceeded box-office expectations. While the phenomenon began as a joke about the two films' seemingly endless differences, some media commentators have pointed out similarities between them; both films have been analyzed as exploring existentialism and the theoretical notion of the Anthropocene, each has an Oscar-nominated director and screenwriter and a large ensemble cast, and both were produced by a husband-and-wife production company.\nThought: The directors of the movies associated with the Barbenheimer phenomenon are Greta Gerwig (Barbie) and Christopher Nolan (Oppenheimer).\nAction: Finish[Greta Gerwig, Christopher Nolan]\n\n&gt; Finished chain.\n\n\n'Greta Gerwig, Christopher Nolan'\n\n\n\nreact_agent.run('Who are the authors of the paper that proposed the original transformer model?')\n\n\n\n&gt; Entering new AgentExecutor chain...\nThought: I need to search the paper that proposed the original transformer model, then find its authors.\nAction: Search[transformer model]\nObservation: Could not find [transformer model].

The modern transformer was proposed in the 2017 paper titled 'Attention Is All You Need' by Ashish Vaswani et al., Google Brain team. It is notable for requiring less training time than previous recurrent neural architectures, such as long short-term memory (LSTM), and its later variation has been prevalently adopted for training large language models on large (language) datasets, such as the Wikipedia corpus and Common Crawl, by virtue of the parallelized processing of input sequence.\nInput text is split into n-grams encoded as tokens and each token is converted into a vector via looking up from a word embedding table. At each layer, each token is then contextualized within the scope of the context window with other (unmasked) tokens via a parallel multi-head attention mechanism allowing the signal for key tokens to be amplified and less important tokens to be diminished. Though the transformer paper was published in 2017, the softmax-based attention mechanism was proposed earlier in 2014 by Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio for machine translation, and the Fast Weight Controller, similar to a transformer, was proposed in 1992 by Schmidhuber.\nThis architecture is now used not only in natural language processing and computer vision, but also in audio and multi-modal processing. It has also led to the development of pre-trained systems, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).\nThought: Authors of the paper are Ashish Vaswani et al. and the paper is titled Attention Is All You Need.\nAction: Finish[Ashish Vaswani et al., Attention Is All You Need]\n\n&gt; Finished chain.\n\n\n'Ashish Vaswani et al., Attention Is All You Need'\n\n\n\nreact_agent.run('Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?')\n\n\n\n&gt; Entering new AgentExecutor chain...\nThought: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who.

Milhouse is Bart Simpson's best friend in Mrs. Krabappel's fourth grade class at Springfield Elementary School. He is insecure, gullible, and is often led into trouble by Bart, who takes advantage of his friend's naïveté. Milhouse is a regular target for school bully Nelson Muntz and his friends Jimbo Jones, Dolph Starbeam and Kearney Zzyzwicz. He has an unrequited crush on Bart's sister, Lisa, which is a common plot element.\nMilhouse debuted in the 1988 commercial \"The Butterfinger Group\" while The Simpsons was still airing as a cartoon short series on the Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show. When The Simpsons was greenlit for a full series by Fox, Milhouse became one of the series' most prominent recurring characters. Groening chose the name Milhouse, also the middle name of President Richard Nixon, because it was the most \"unfortunate name [he] could think of for a kid\". Milhouse's appearance is based on that of Rob Cohen.\nThought: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\nAction: Finish[Richard Nixon]\n\n&gt; Finished chain.\n\n\n'Richard Nixon'"

    "text": "Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) [1] is a framework for LLM inference. It allows models to explore multiple reasoning paths and make deliberate decisions for problem solving. ToT generalizes over the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approach and enables LLMs to generate and evaluate thoughts, which are coherent units of text, as intermediate steps toward a final solution. It organizes thoughts into a data structure of branching tree based on an evaluation score of a thought. Thoughts could be, - a question - a hypothesis - a plan - a partial solution - any texts that help models to solve the problem\nThe paper demonstrates that ToT significantly improves the performance of LLMs on three tasks that require non-trivial planning or search: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Mini Crosswords."

Each tree node is a state \\(s = [x, z_{1···i} ]\\) that consists of the input and the sequence of thoughts generated until that point. This way, ToT can explore different reasoning paths and find the best solution for the given problem.\nToT follows the following steps:\n\nuse a thought generator to generate thoughts for a tree node. Each thought should be not too “big” and not too “small”.\n\nfor rich thought space: sample i.i.d. thoughts from a CoT prompt because i.i.d. samples lead to diversity\nfor more constrained thought space: propose thoughts sequentially by a propose prompt, which could avoid duplication\n\nuse a state evaluator as a heuristic for the search algorithm\n\nevaluate the frontier states based on one of the following two strategies:\n\nvalue each state independently\nvote across states\n\n\nuse a search algorithm, e.g. BFS or DFS, to traverse through the tree\n\nselect the most promising child node at each level, and generating new thoughts from it\n\nBreadth-first search (BFS): maintains a set of the most promising states per step\n\nfor tasks where the tree depth is limited and initial thought steps can be evaluated and pruned to a small set\n\nDepth-first search (DFS): picks the most promising state first, until reaching the final output or a dead-end; It backtracks to the parent state to continue exploration"

Preheat your oven to 450-500°F (230-260°C).\n2. If using homemade pizza dough, let it rise for 1-2 hours until it is puffy and doubled in size. If using store-bought dough, follow the package instructions for thawing and rising.\n3. Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer the dough to a pizza pan or baking sheet.\n4. Spread the pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.\n5. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.\n6. Add your desired toppings, such as pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers.\n7. Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.\n8. Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.\n\nEnjoy your homemade pizza!\n\n\nThe answer is not bad.

Making pizza can be a fun and delicious activity. Here's a basic recipe for making pizza at home:\nIngredients:\n* 1 1/2 cups warm water\n* 2 tablespoons active dry yeast\n* 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 1 cup pizza sauce (homemade or store-bought)\n* Toppings of your choice (such as cheese, vegetables, meats, etc.)\nInstructions:\n1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm water and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until the yeast becomes frothy.\n2. Add the flour, salt, and olive oil to the bowl. Mix until a dough forms.\n3. Knead the dough on a floured surface for 5-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.\n4. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for 1-2 hours until it has doubled in size.\n5. Preheat your oven to 450-500°F (230-260°C).\n6. Punch down the dough and divide it into as many portions as you want to make individual pizzas.\n7. Roll out each portion of dough into a thin circle, about 1/4 inch thick.\n8. Place the dough on a pizza stone or baking sheet.\n9. Spread the pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.\n10. Add your desired toppings.\n11. Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 10-15 minutes until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.\n12. Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.\nEnjoy your homemade pizza!\n\nPlease note that this is a basic recipe and you can always adjust it to your liking by adding different toppings or using different types of cheese. Also, if you want to make a gluten-free pizza, you can use a gluten-free flour blend instead of all-purpose flour."
